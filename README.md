## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model
that can classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
using Natural Language Processing and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the text dataset
- Cleaned and preprocessed text data
- Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Built a sentiment classification model using Naive Bayes
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualized sentiment distribution and results

## Outcome & Learnings
- Successfully classified text sentiment into three categories
- Gained hands-on experience with NLP preprocessing techniques
- Learned how machine learning models can analyze textual data
- Understood practical challenges in sentiment classification

## Project Files
- `Task4_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `Twitter_Data.csv` – Dataset used for sentiment analysis
